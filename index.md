## Wu Li Hao

### Upgrading a traditional noodle business

Wu Li Hao are a family-run noodle manufacturing business who handled production and distribution of their handmade noodles with a complicated logistics system involving phone calls, piles of faxed invoices, large A3-printed timetables, hundreds of Excel sheets, and a *lot* of time.

With a new factory space on the way, they realised that their current proccesses were not scalable, and reached out to us to commission a platform to revamp their production and supply chain.
