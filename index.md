## Wu Li Hao

### Upgrading a traditional noodle business

Wu Li Hao (WLH) are a family-run noodle manufacturing business who handled production and distribution of their handmade noodles with a complicated logistics system involving phone calls, piles of faxed invoices, large A3-printed timetables, hundreds of Excel sheets, and a *lot* of time.

With a new factory space on the way, they realised that their current proccesses were not scalable, and reached out to us to commission a platform to revamp their production and supply chain.

### Team and Process

We were a team of four computer science undergraduates doing small freelance projects. For the WLH project, I handled the requirements gathering and UI/UX design. 

There was a ton of work to be done for three different user groups: administrators, customers, and delivery drivers. Since the current system was so complex and manual, we had to pry apart each step to synthesise the process in a way that could be automated and was more efficient - but also easy to learn and use.

We ended up creating separate apps for each user group, with mobile (both iOS and Android) for customer orders and the delivery system, and a desktop adminstration app to manage the overall supply chain. All of these are available in both English and Mandarin,

I began by understanding each user's unique needs. We conducted interviews and went on-site to see how the whole business ran and get an in-depth view of what problems we had to solve. I then constructed user stories and paper wireframes. After running the paper frames by our client, I mapped out all user flows, specifications, and made both static and interactive wireframes for the engineers. We iterated multiple times on them. The work presented here is near the end of the process, but not the final versions.
